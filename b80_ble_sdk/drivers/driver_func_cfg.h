//When pengcheng.xu tested the SRAM program, he found that the suspend sleep current was too large when the program was downloaded immediately after being active;
//after debugging, it was found that the MCU was stalled because the chip boot did not finish running, and the otp was not turned off, so the sleep current was too large.
//If it is a ram program SRAM_OTP_FLASH_HANDLE needs to be set to 1, then the driver processing is:
//in active mode, the power of the OTP flash is present to ensure that the otp flash function can be used normally,
//but the current at this time will be higher (Compared to the normal OTP or flash program), the specific data is as follows:
//In sleep mode, the otp will enter deep, and the flash will be powered off to ensure that the sleep current is normal
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// 		  				otp active mode	    otp deep standby mode
// open flash ldo 			6.80mA					5.35mA
// close flash ldo			4.44mA					2.99mA
